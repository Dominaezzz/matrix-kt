/**
 * Synchronise the client's state with the latest state on the server.
 * Clients use this API when they first log in to get an initial snapshot
 * of the state on the server, and then continue to call this API to get
 * incremental deltas to the state, and to receive new messages.
 *
 * *Note*: This endpoint supports lazy-loading. See `Filtering <#filtering>`_
 * for more information. Lazy-loading members is only supported on a ``StateFilter``
 * for this endpoint. When lazy-loading is enabled, servers MUST include the
 * syncing user's own membership event when they join a room, or when the
 * full state of rooms is requested, to aid discovering the user's avatar &
 * displayname.
 *
 * Like other members, the user's own membership event is eligible
 * for being considered redundant by the server. When a sync is ``limited``,
 * the server MUST return membership events for events in the gap
 * (between ``since`` and the start of the returned timeline), regardless
 * as to whether or not they are redundant.  This ensures that joins/leaves
 * and profile changes which occur during the gap are not lost.
