/**
 * Remove a mapping of room alias to room ID.
 *
 * Servers may choose to implement additional access control checks here, for instance that
 * room aliases can only be deleted by their creator or a server administrator.
 *
 * .. Note::
 *    Servers may choose to update the ``alt_aliases`` for the ``m.room.canonical_alias``
 *    state event in the room when an alias is removed. Servers which choose to update the
 *    canonical alias event are recommended to, in addition to their other relevant permission
 *    checks, delete the alias and return a successful response even if the user does not
 *    have permission to update the ``m.room.canonical_alias`` event.
