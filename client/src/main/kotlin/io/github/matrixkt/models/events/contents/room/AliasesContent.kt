 * This event is sent by a homeserver directly to inform of changes to the list of aliases it knows about for that room.
 * The `state_key` for this event is set to the homeserver which owns the room alias.
 * The entire set of known aliases for the room is the union of all the `m.room.aliases` events, one for each homeserver.
 * Clients **should** check the validity of any room alias given in this list before presenting it to the user as trusted fact.
 * The lists given by this event should be considered simply as advice on which aliases might exist,
 * for which the client can perform the lookup to confirm whether it receives the correct room ID.
