/**
 * Adjusts the membership state for a user in a room.
 * It is preferable to use the membership APIs (`/rooms/<room id>/invite` etc) when performing membership
 * actions rather than adjusting the state directly as there are a restricted set of valid transformations.
 * For example, user A cannot force user B to join a room, and trying to force this state change directly will fail.
 *
 * The following membership states are specified:
 * - `invite` - The user has been invited to join a room, but has not yet joined it. They may not participate in the room until they join.
 * - `join` - The user has joined the room (possibly after accepting an invite), and may participate in it.
 * - `leave` - The user was once joined to the room, but has since left (possibly by choice, or possibly by being kicked).
 * - `ban` - The user has been banned from the room, and is no longer allowed to join it until they are un-banned from the room (by having their membership state set to a value other than ban).
 * - `knock` - This is a reserved word, which currently has no meaning.
 *
 * The `third_party_invite` property will be set if this invite is an `invite` event and is the successor of an `m.room.third_party_invite` event, and absent otherwise.
 *
 * This event may also include an `invite_room_state` key inside the event's `unsigned` data.
 * If present, this contains an array of `StrippedState` Events.
 * These events provide information on a subset of state events such as the room name.
 *
 * The user for which a membership applies is represented by the `state_key`.
 * Under some conditions, the `sender` and `state_key` may not match - this may
 * be interpreted as the `sender` affecting the membership state of the `state_key` user.
 *
 * The `membership` for a given user can change over time.
 * The table below represents the various changes over time and how clients and servers must interpret those changes.
 * Previous membership can be retrieved from the `prev_content` object on an event.
 * If not present, the user's previous membership must be assumed as `leave`.
