/**
 * *Note that there are two forms of this API, which are documented separately.
 * This version of the API requires that the inviter knows the Matrix
 * identifier of the invitee. The other is documented in the*
 * [third party invites section](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidinvite-1).
 *
 * This API invites a user to participate in a particular room.
 * They do not start participating in the room until they actually join the
 * room.
 *
 * Only users currently in a particular room can invite other users to
 * join that room.
 *
 * If the user was invited to the room, the homeserver will append a
 * `m.room.member` event to the room.
