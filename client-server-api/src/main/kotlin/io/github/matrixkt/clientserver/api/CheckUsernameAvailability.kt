/**
 * Checks to see if a username is available, and valid, for the server.

 * The server should check to ensure that, at the time of the request, the
 * username requested is available for use. This includes verifying that an
 * application service has not claimed the username and that the username
 * fits the server's desired requirements (for example, a server could dictate
 * that it does not permit usernames with underscores).
 *
 * Matrix clients may wish to use this API prior to attempting registration,
 * however the clients must also be aware that using this API does not normally
 * reserve the username. This can mean that the username becomes unavailable
 * between checking its availability and attempting to register it.
